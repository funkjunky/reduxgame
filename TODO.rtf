\f0\fs24 \cf0 game todo:\
\'97\
\
 *- turn the ship into a polygon sorta like geometry wars [hex with square at front]\
	*- origin centre\
 *- add mouse for rotation of ship\
	*- add rotation variables, but don\'92t put in drawing yet\
	*- put rotate in drawing.\
 *- put friction and terminal in state.world.physics\
 *- add shooting bullets with left mouse click [little circles]\
	*- bullets are entities, bullets have their own friction of zero\
 *- add infinite level\
 - bullet speed should be normalized\
 - add generating random asteroids [polygons]\
	- rotate the asteroids slowly, random speed and direction.\
\
 - add a tagging system or something to grab entities by\'85 so we can use that for controls\'85\
\
 - add collision with bullets and asteroids so they make smaller asteroids that will NOT split after being hit\
 - add score to destroying asteroids\
 - add collision with ship for asteroid, reset state except life, which i reduce by 1\
	- ALSO collision of bullet with ship! same idea!\
\
 - add tests\
\
 - new gameplay\
	- add a portal oval entity\
	- bullets now freeze asteroid movement [bullets yellow]\
	- when entering portal change state\
		- ship is now blue\
		- background is patches of varying grey [rectangles]\
		- so asteroids can be destroyed\
		- asteroids don\'92t destroy the ship [can still see white asteroids, but 70% alpha]\
		- large walls start coming in at an ever increasing rate across the map [blue]\
		- hold right click to phase back into the real world to avoid walls [walls 70% alpha]\
			- also background normal while phasing back in. [and asteroids 100% alpha]\
			- a rectangle inside the ship indicates how much phase is left [white]\
			- when phase runs out, you are returned to the real world and the alternate world is reset.}
